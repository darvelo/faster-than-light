Be consistent
Offer value
Put energy into your work and into your life
Bring something new: That might be your story, or your style, or your experience, or your personality, or your technology, or your situation, or what you are doing – whatever it is, it needs to be unique.
Be prolific: Being prolific spreads your message further, it results in your presence expanding, it demonstrates your credibility and devotion to your craft, it’s a representation of your passion and your passion is addictive to others with a similar passion. You have better chances at success because you are in more places at once.
Take advantage of your time
Seize opportunities
Be willing to fail fast - you learn and find good ideas faster.
Plan ahead but be flexible: With a plan it's easier to know when the time is right to move forward. But don't be afraid to go in a different direction if the timing is right.
Be positive.
Be that person that can change someone's day from bad to good.
