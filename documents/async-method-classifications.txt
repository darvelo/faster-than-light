async.auto

async.waterfall

async.series
async.parallel



asynchronously:

perform operations on collections
test collections and return result of that test

call an async function while a synchronous test is true (or false)
call an async function over and over, forever

perform async functions in series, final callback with results
perform async functions in parallel, final callback with results

perform async functions in series, each passing callbacks to the next one, final callback when done

graph which async functions are dependent on the others


push async functions into a queue with options on which are called when and to modify the stack
