I want to contribute to society by empowering people to become more aware of what they want and need to accomplish, and to establish a framework for how they will be able to accomplish it. It will greatly simplify the overview and management of all their tasks, and will make it easy for them to add, remove, view, or modify what they need done. In addition, they'll be able to keep track of their progress in a way that's meaningful to them, with their ability to be reflective and receive rewards for completing important tasks. They should be able to be more aware of how they spend their time so that they can maximize it to their benefit. Because they trust me with their personal data, I'm motivated not to violate that trust and privacy, and will not sell or give away their data to anyone else.
