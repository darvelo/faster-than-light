figure out a way that the site will get lots of pageviews. i think this means having public profiles that others would be interested in seeing. this makes for exponential pageviews than a single person viewing their own page. this is if the site isn't subscription-based, or if there's a hybrid monetary model.

Colors:
-------

* think first of the largest color, which will be the most dominant. it sets the tone for the rest of the color hierarchy
* value and saturation contrast, focus, and grouping control a viewer's eye
* there's no such thing as a good color. there are only good color relationships. the relationships of hue, value, and saturation
* text must have contrast of value if you want viewers to read the text
* you can use a thin slice of a hue to have different matching colors
* different colors have different natural "values" (black to white). red and blue tend to be darker than yellow at the same saturation, for example.
