Mongoose:
  http://mongoose/docs/guide.html#indexes
    When your application starts up, Mongoose automatically calls ensureIndex for each defined index in your schema. While nice for development, it is recommended this behavior be disabled in production since index creation can cause a significant performance impact. Disable the behavior by setting the autoIndex option of your schema to false.

    animalSchema.set('autoIndex', false);
    // or
    new Schema({..}, { autoIndex: false });
