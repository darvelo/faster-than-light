This project will eventually be a full-featured time management web application,
but different from most.

FTL is not ready for contributions yet. The backend code is pretty hackish, and
the frontend will be moving from Backbone to Ember. I've got to get the design
documents finalized and some blog posts or a website made in some far-off time
and place.

## Why the codename faster-than-light?

According to relativity theory, an object traveling at the speed of light will
experience time slower than other objects. If we could slow down time, we could
get a lot more stuff done!
